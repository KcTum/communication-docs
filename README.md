# Communication among SHOP4CF components 

This is documentation of communication among SHOP4CF components.

As the first step, we document input/output of components.
The purpose is to identify similarities and propose an uniform 
[FIWARE data model](https://fiware-datamodels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
for communication among components 
(and also for communication between the components and other systems in pilot locations).  

Draft documentation files are already present in this repo for each component.
Responsible project partners are expected to update them, 
and __to keep updating them in the future__, if needed.  

## Contributing

You can also find your files starting from the index: [index.md](docs/index.md).
